# Collision Avoidance


As a Robot user I want to my robot to avoid colliding with people or objects so that it won't damage anything or hurt anyone

> 作为一名机器人用户，我希望我的机器人避免与人或物体相撞，这样它就不会损坏任何东西或伤害任何人

## More details

- Why is this needed?

  - This is needed for indoor and outdoor robot navigation in most (all?) cases

  - Example: a robot in a warehouse should avoid colliding into the walls or shelving, and dynamically avoid people that cross its path

> -例如：仓库中的机器人应避免撞到墙壁或货架上，并动态避开穿过其路径的人

- What is the expected user interaction?


  - The user should be able to walk in front of a robot and it should avoid crashing into that person

> -用户应该能够走在机器人前面，并且应该避免撞到那个人

- Are there any non-functional requirements? (build system, tools, performance, etc)
