# Indoor Localization


As a Robot user I want my robot to know its location on a given map of an indoor area so that it can move around the area

> 作为一名机器人用户，我想让我的机器人知道它在给定的室内区域地图上的位置，这样它就可以在该区域周围移动

## More details

- Why is this needed?

  - This is needed for indoor robot navigation in most (all?) cases
  - Example: a courier robot in a logistics warehouse

- What is the expected user interaction?

  - The user should be able to specify a map to use and a location on that map for the robot
  - The robot should be able to deduce it's own position on a map autonomously

- Are there any non-functional requirements? (build system, tools, performance, etc)
