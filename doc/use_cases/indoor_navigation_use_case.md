# Indoor Navigation


As a Robot user I want my robot to autonomously navigate to a given location on a given map so that it can help me at that location

> 作为一名机器人用户，我希望我的机器人能够自主导航到给定地图上的给定位置，以便在该位置帮助我

## More details

- Why is this needed?

  - This is needed for indoor robot navigation in most (all?) cases
  - Example: a courier robot in a logistics warehouse

- What is the expected user interaction?


  - The user should be able to specify a map to use and a location on that map for the robot to move to.

> -用户应该能够指定要使用的地图和机器人移动到的地图上的位置。

- Are there any non-functional requirements? (build system, tools, performance, etc)
