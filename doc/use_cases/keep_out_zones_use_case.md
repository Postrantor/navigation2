# Keep Out Zones


As a Robot user I want to be able to designate keep-out zones or areas on a map so that my robot will go around those areas instead of through them

> 作为一名机器人用户，我希望能够在地图上指定禁区或区域，这样我的机器人就可以绕过这些区域，而不是穿过它们

## More details

- Why is this needed?


  - This is needed for indoor/outdoor robot navigation in areas where there may be safety issues or hazards

> -这是在可能存在安全问题或危险的区域进行室内/室外机器人导航所必需的

  - Example: a courier robot in a logistics warehouse may be required to avoid areas where the forklift is unloading pallets from trucks

> -示例：物流仓库中的快递机器人可能需要避开叉车从卡车上卸载托盘的区域

- What is the expected user interaction?

  - The user should be able to specify keep out zones for the robot to avoid

- Are there any non-functional requirements? (build system, tools, performance, etc)
