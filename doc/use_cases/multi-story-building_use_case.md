# Multi-story Building Navigation (2D+)


As a Robot user I want my robot to be able to navigate stairways, ramps or elevators to move to another portion of the multi-story building so that it can do something useful

> 作为一名机器人用户，我希望我的机器人能够导航楼梯、坡道或电梯，移动到多层建筑的另一部分，这样它就可以做一些有用的事情

## More details

- Why is this needed?

  - Example: a delivery robot in an office building

- What is the expected user interaction?


  - The user should be able to specify stairways, ramps and elevators on a map for a robot to use or not use

> -用户应该能够在地图上指定机器人使用或不使用的楼梯、坡道和电梯
    - via a GUI
    - via a config file or API so that it can be done by another program

- Are there any non-functional requirements? (build system, tools, performance, etc)
